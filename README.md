 ## This project is currently in development.
 
A simple SPA application using React and Redux Toolkits for data storage and processing, including Redux thunk for asynchronous logic and data fetching. The project implements CRUD operations, search, and pagination. Later, it was migrated to SCSS for styling and made responsive for different devices. In addition, the ability to change the theme with saving to the local storage using the Context API was added.
